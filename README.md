# requirement-analysis
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a system or application. It forms the first step of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and ensures that the development team builds a solution aligned with business and user goals.

Key Aspects:

Defines what the system should do, not how it will do it.

Bridges the gap between clients, users, and developers.

Minimizes risks, reduces cost, and increases the success rate of projects.

### What is Requirement Analysis?

Clarity & Alignment – Ensures stakeholders and developers share the same vision.

Cost & Time Efficiency – Reduces rework, errors, and miscommunication.

Quality & Success – Sets clear criteria for testing, validation, and project acceptance.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Clarity & Alignment – Ensures stakeholders and developers share the same vision.

Cost & Time Efficiency – Reduces rework, errors, and miscommunication.

Quality & Success – Sets clear criteria for testing, validation, and project acceptance.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

Requirement Gathering → Collecting user needs through interviews, surveys, and documents.

Requirement Elicitation → Engaging stakeholders to clarify requirements.

Requirement Documentation → Structuring requirements in clear, precise formats.

Requirement Analysis & Modeling → Creating diagrams, models, and logical structures.

Requirement Validation → Confirming that requirements meet business needs.

### Types of Requirements.
✅ Functional Requirements

Define what the system should do.

Examples (Booking System):

Users can search for available rooms by date and location.

Users can create, edit, and cancel bookings.

The system should send email confirmations for bookings.

⚙️ Non-Functional Requirements

Define how the system performs.

Examples (Booking System):

The system must handle at least 500 concurrent users.

Bookings must be processed within 2 seconds.

The application should comply with GDPR for data protection.

### Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams illustrate the interactions between actors (users or systems) and the system’s functions.

Benefits:

Clarifies scope of the system.

Helps visualize user interactions.

Ensures completeness of requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. They help ensure alignment between business needs and developer output.

Example (Checkout Feature):

User must be able to review booking details before payment.

Payment gateway must securely process transactions.

A booking confirmation email must be sent after successful payment.

If payment fails, the user must be notified and allowed to retry.
